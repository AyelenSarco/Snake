# Snake
Snake-based video game development for learning purposes
This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game in Unity, created for the purpose of studying game development with Unity.

## Objective
The objective of the game is to control the snake, which is represented as a series of connected squares, and guide it to eat food items that appear on the game board. As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, making it harder to control and navigate around the game board without colliding with the snake's body.

## Gameplay
The game begins with the snake in the center of the game board, and the player must use the arrow or 'A','S','D','W' keys to control the direction of the snake's movement. The snake will continue moving in the chosen direction until the player changes its direction or its own body.

Food items will appear at random locations on the game board, and the player must guide the snake to eat them by directing the snake's head towards the food item. Each time the snake eats a food item, it will grow longer.

The game ends when the snake collides with its own body. The player's score is based on the number of food items the snake has eaten before it collides.

## Technologies Used
This game was created using Unity, a popular game development engine. The scripting language used to create the game was C#.

## Credits
This game was created as a part of my studies in game development with Unity. The code for this game is available on Github for educational purposes only. Any feedback or suggestions for improvements are welcome.
